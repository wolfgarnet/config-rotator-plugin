/**
 * RunLister implements onCompleted method that runs for every job on Jenkins
 * when completed, thus we check if it is a CR job and harvest the result of
 * the configuration.
 * <p/>
 * Design notes - using a runListener vs. notifier for writing feed
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * <p/>
 * http://jenkinshost/config-rotator shows a summary with atom-feed and links
 * for the feed for every configuration of component tried with the config-rotator
 * plug-in (from now denoted CR) on the Jenkins host.
 * <p/>
 * That is every job using the plug-in could have a result that should be shown
 * in one or more feeds, thus we must "subscribe" or ensure these data are
 * collected.
 * <p/>
 * We already decided for an easy format for storing the feed - one file per
 * component in the feed XML format.
 * <p/>
 * The feed can be written easily from two places: a runlistener or from the
 * notifier part of CR.
 * <p/>
 * We chose to implement this as a runlistener we find the runlistener way of
 * doing it more clear instead of using the notifier (the post build step).
 * We know there might be some concurrency problems writing the feed files
 * if a lots of build finish at the same time.
 * TODO: This will be handled later and implemented.
 * <p/>
 * Writing feeds: we would have liked to use a fully tested and mature open
 * source library for writing feeds, and did a short searching and found to
 * large one: ROME and Apache Abdera
 * ROME though, seemed not to be maintained or changed for some time,
 * but seemed the easiest to use.
 * NONE of them did we succeed in use: both had weird classloader problems under
 * Jenkins (but not if using them alone). The problem seems to comes from Jenkins
 * making the hpi file, from splits of jar-files. Others have this problem,
 * and we do to with some internal libraries (cool test case not being able to
 * use setup.xml across projects).
 * Thus we ended up creating our own simple framework in praqmajutils

     * Writes entries to an existing feed, which is read from the component-
     * feedfile. If this file does not exist, an initial feed is created incl.
     * the file.
     * <p/>
     * Upon adding the new entry, the feed is written to the file
     * (overwriting the existing feed).
     * Feed clients uses the entries id and timestamps, so they only see
     * the new entries added.
     * <p/>
     * A component, as we for now only speak ClearCase, is only unique combined
     * with the PVob-name, so component feed-files are stored in folders under
     * there PVob in the feed-directory.
     * <p/>
     * When a configuration is know to be compatible or incompatible, several
     * feeds must be updated. Say CR1-1 and CR2-1 and CR3-2 all in PVob 'myPVob'
     * was found to be compatible, then three feed are updated.
     * Eg. CR1-1 feed becomes an entry about it found compatible or incompatible
     * with components CR2-1 and CR3-2.
     * CR2-1 will have a feed entry about compatibility with CR1-1 and CR3-2.
     * They will be stored in:
     * JENKINNS-ROOTFOLDER/config-rotator/feed/myPVob/CR1-1.xml etc.
